    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS Stand for Cascading Stylesheet</li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML, element are to diplayed on screen, paper or other media</li>
        <li><span id="box1">CSS is not neccssary</span> <span id="box2">CSS save a lot of work</span>.It can controll the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span id="box3">External stylesheet are stored in CSS file</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added in HTML in three ways:</h2>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline- by usinfg the style attributes inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element to link an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the style in external CSS file. How ever,<span id="box4"> in the tutorial we will use inline and internal style</span>, because this is eaiser to demonstrate, and eaiser for you try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
